PROBLEM STATEMENT:
We have chosen health and WellBeing in the Vultr’s Hack-a-Thon as healthcare is time consuming due to unreliable, insufficient and inaccurate medical disclosures. Pregnant women and new parents often face overwhelming challenges in managing their health and wellness during pregnancy and the early years of child development. Many existing solutions provide fragmented support, lacking a comprehensive approach that covers prenatal care,prenatal care, postnatal support, and child health management up to age 10. This can lead to confusion regarding medical guidance, missed appointments, and inadequate access to essential resources, including online prescriptions and tracking tools. Additionally, parents may struggle to find reliable information, connect with healthcare professionals, and engage with a community of support. To address these gaps, there is a pressing need for a unified app that offers complete pregnancy care and early childhood support, facilitating efficient health tracking, access to online prescriptions, and a robust network of resources for both mothers and children. This will empower families to make informed decisions, streamline healthcare processes, and enhance overall well-being throughout this crucial period.
PROPOSED SOLUTION:
The app will provide comprehensive support for mothers and children from pregnancy through age 10. It will feature a personalized pregnancy tracker that monitors key milestones and offers tailored health advice. HealthMitra will include an online prescription service, enabling users to consult with healthcare professionals and receive medications directly through the app. Additionally, it will house a rich library of resources on prenatal and early childhood care, as well as a community forum for parents to connect and share experiences. This holistic approach will empower families to manage health and wellness seamlessly and confidently.

The users will expect to gain enhanced knowledge about pregnancy and development of the child so as to make better decisions. Online prescription accessibility will improve faster access to drugs that are needed, which usually prolong waiting periods. Creating a positive community atmosphere will also help to empower parents, who will have a platform to share their experiences with other parents and benefit from the emotional support. We ultimately try to reduce health care fragmentation, promote preventive health care practices, and support healthier families, and these, in turn, continue to influence healthy maternal and child health outcomes into the future!

 DETAILED PROJECT PLAN
The core goal of Health Mitra is to streamline healthcare access by developing a robust, user-friendly platform that addresses healthcare management challenges, especially in resource-constrained settings.  Some of the main goals include the development of a scalable API that supports 10,000 users, increasing the processing speed of data by 20%, and affording real-time insights into health data.Targeted towards healthcare providers, patients, and administrators, Health Mitra benefits the Vultr environment by utilizing cloud infrastructure to ensure secure, scalable, and efficient data handling, fostering a reliable digital health solution.
The Health Mitra project timeline consists of four main phases: Research, Development, Testing, and Deployment. During the Research phase (Weeks 1–3), we’ll finalize user needs and functional requirements, with a milestone of completing a detailed requirements document. The Development phase (Weeks 4–8) includes building the core platform, with a milestone of achieving a scalable API prototype. Testing (Weeks 8–10) will ensure performance and security standards, with a milestone of passing all functional tests. Finally, Deployment (Weeks 11–13) will focus on launching and initial user onboarding.
Key deliverables of Health Mitra include a fully functional healthcare management platform accessible via web and mobile applications, with scalable API for easy integration of healthcare systems. Documentation deliverables include a technical documentation that explains the full detail of system architecture, an API guide for developers, and a user manual for end-users. The final demo would integrate core functionalities such as real-time health data access, user-friendly dashboards, and security features. Performance optimization, scaling success, and conclusions of the user experience while testing some of the things included in the final report.
